I fine-tuned the Mistral-7B LLM on the ExploreGB dataset to promote tourism in Gilgit-Baltistan. 
The model accurately identifies top destinations such as Hunza Valley, Skardu, and Fairy Meadows. 
It also provides insights into the rich culture, history, and cuisine of the region. Travelers can 
learn about traditional festivals, ancient forts, and delicious local dishes like chapshuro and harissa. 
With enhanced information, exploring the breathtaking landscapes and vibrant heritage of Gilgit-Baltistan 
becomes a seamless experience. The model's recommendations ensure tourists have a comprehensive and enjoyable visit.
